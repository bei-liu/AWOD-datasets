# WRRT-DETR: Weather-Robust RT-DETR for Drone-View Object Detection in Adverse Weather
The dataset associated with our paper is currently being finalized and will be made publicly available upon publication.

ðŸ”§ Ongoing Updates
We are currently organizing the dataset into the following formats:

COCO-style JSON annotations: for use with standard object detection frameworks (e.g., Detectron2, MMDetection).

YOLO-style text annotations: for use with YOLOv5/YOLOv8 and similar models.

Pascal VOC format XML annotation: Suitable for traditional object detection methods and classic data processing pipelines.
